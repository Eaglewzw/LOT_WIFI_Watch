Support for this Lua module has been discontinued.

Equivalent functionality is available from the si7021 module in the NodeMCU
firmware code base. Refer to `docs/en/modules/si7021.md` for API documentation.

The original Lua code can be found in the [git repository](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/tree/3e24b1c75b4b4fd469be784fd5d596f0eb3871ff/lua_modules/si7021).
